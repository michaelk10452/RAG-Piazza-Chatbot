# ðŸŽ“ RAG-Piazza Chatbot

## ðŸ“Œ System Overview
The **RAG-Piazza Chatbot** is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**-based course assistant designed to enhance student learning through **efficient and intelligent information retrieval**. Built using **Streamlit, FAISS, and OpenAI GPT**, the chatbot enables students to interact with their course material, syllabus, and Piazza discussions dynamically, retrieving the most relevant information before generating accurate responses.

This system was originally built for **CS 101** and comes with a preloaded dataset that has been vectorized and chunked for optimal performance. However, it can be easily modified to work with any course that has Piazza post data, a syllabus, and other course materials.

## ðŸš€ Why This System Stands Out
- **Optimized for Speed**: Precomputed FAISS embeddings ensure near-instantaneous retrieval of relevant course materials.
- **Scalability & Efficiency**: Designed with **vector databases (FAISS)** to handle large-scale information retrieval tasks with minimal latency.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Unlike traditional chatbots, it combines document retrieval with GPT-generated responses, ensuring answers are grounded in **relevant course materials**.
- **User-Centric Interface**: Built with **Streamlit**, offering a sleek, easy-to-use chat interface for students and educators.
- **Secure API Key Handling**: Uses `.env` files and Streamlit Secrets to **protect sensitive credentials** and ensure safe API usage.

## ðŸ§  Why RAG is Critical for Educational Assistants
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is particularly valuable for educational applications like this course assistant:

- **Knowledge Accuracy**: By grounding responses in verified course materials, RAG prevents hallucination and ensures information accuracyâ€”critical for educational contexts where factual correctness is non-negotiable.
- **Up-to-Date Information**: Easily incorporate course-specific content including the latest lectures, Piazza discussions, and instructor announcements without retraining the entire model.
- **Course-Specific Context**: Captures nuances of how specific concepts are taught in CS 101, respecting the instructor's terminology and pedagogical approach.
- **Cited Sources**: Enables the system to reference specific materials, allowing students to verify information and explore topics more deeply in the original course documents.
- **Reduced Bias**: Minimizes inherent biases in foundation models by prioritizing retrieving actual course content over generating responses from pre-trained knowledge.
