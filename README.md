# 🎓 RAG-Piazza Chatbot

## 📌 System Overview
The **RAG-Piazza Chatbot** is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**-based course assistant designed to enhance student learning through **efficient and intelligent information retrieval**. Built using **Streamlit, FAISS, and OpenAI GPT**, the chatbot enables students to interact with their course material, syllabus, and Piazza discussions dynamically, retrieving the most relevant information before generating accurate responses.

## 🚀 Why This System Stands Out
- **Optimized for Speed**: Precomputed FAISS embeddings ensure near-instantaneous retrieval of relevant course materials.
- **Scalability & Efficiency**: Designed with **vector databases (FAISS)** to handle large-scale information retrieval tasks with minimal latency.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Unlike traditional chatbots, it combines document retrieval with GPT-generated responses, ensuring answers are grounded in **relevant course materials**.
- **User-Centric Interface**: Built with **Streamlit**, offering a sleek, easy-to-use chat interface for students and educators.
- **Secure API Key Handling**: Uses `.env` files and Streamlit Secrets to **protect sensitive credentials** and ensure safe API usage.

## 💡 Strengths Demonstrated
### **1️⃣ Full-Stack AI & Machine Learning Expertise**
- Developed a **full RAG pipeline** that integrates **vector search (FAISS) with LLMs (GPT-4)**.
- Applied **efficient embedding storage and retrieval techniques** to optimize chatbot performance.

### **2️⃣ System Design & Optimization**
- Leveraged **precomputed vector databases** to reduce response time and OpenAI API calls, making the system cost-efficient.
- Ensured **seamless integration between retrieval (FAISS) and generation (GPT-4)** for accurate, context-aware responses.

### **3️⃣ Web App Development & Deployment**
- Built a **fully interactive UI** using **Streamlit**, ensuring an intuitive user experience.
- Successfully **deployed the chatbot on Streamlit Cloud**, demonstrating proficiency in **cloud-based AI solutions**.
