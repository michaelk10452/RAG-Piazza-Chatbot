Example:
```python
class Example:
    count = 0
    
    @classmethod
    def increment(cls):
        cls.count += 1  # Can modify class state
        
    @staticmethod
    def helper():
        return "I can't access class state"
```

flask run

This will show detailed error messages in the browser.

@183 [Handling Large Files in Python]
Student: My program crashes when reading a large file. What’s the best way to handle this?
TA Response: Use a generator to process the file line by line instead of reading it all at once:

def read_large_file(filename):
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line

for line in read_large_file("bigfile.txt"):
    process(line)

This prevents memory overload.

@184 [Midterm Review Materials]
Student: Will we get a practice midterm?
Instructor: Yes, a practice exam will be uploaded to the course website by Friday.

@185 [Debugging Flask API Routes]
Student: My Flask API route keeps returning a 404 error. What could be wrong?

TA Response: Use the command parameter when creating the button:

import tkinter as tk

def on_click():
    print("Button clicked!")

root = tk.Tk()
button = tk.Button(root, text="Click Me", command=on_click)
button.pack()
root.mainloop()

@190 [SQL vs NoSQL for Project]
Student: Should we use SQL or NoSQL for our final project database?
Instructor: SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL) is better for structured data. NoSQL (MongoDB) is better for flexible schemas. Choose based on your project’s needs.

@191 [Function Arguments in Python]
Student: What’s the difference between *args and **kwargs?
TA Response:
	•	*args allows passing multiple positional arguments.
	•	**kwargs allows passing multiple named arguments.

Example:

def example(*args, **kwargs):
    print("Args:", args)
    print("Kwargs:", kwargs)

example(1, 2, 3, name="Alice", age=25)

@192 [Handling Exceptions in Flask]
Student: How can I handle errors in a Flask API?
TA Response: Use error handlers for a clean response:

@app.errorhandler(404)
def not_found(error):
    return {"error": "Not found"}, 404

@193 [Project Proposal Feedback]
Student: Can we get feedback on our final project proposal before submission?
TA Response: Yes! Post it as a private note, and we’ll provide feedback within 48 hours.

@194 [Using SQLite in Python]

Python Basics & Syntax

@221 [Integer Division in Python]
Student: Why does 5 / 2 return 2.5 but 5 // 2 returns 2?
TA Response:
	•	/ performs floating-point division, always returning a decimal.
	•	// performs integer division, rounding down to the nearest whole number.

@222 [Mutable vs Immutable Data Types]
Student: Why can’t we modify a string in Python?
TA Response: Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation. Lists, however, are mutable:

s = "hello"
s[0] = "H"  # ❌ This will throw an error

Use .replace() to modify strings instead.

@223 [Using List Comprehension]
Student: Can we use list comprehensions in HW3 instead of a for loop?
Instructor: Yes, list comprehensions are allowed and often more efficient. Example:

squared = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

Data Structures & Algorithms

	•	Use reversed(): list(reversed(my_list))

@225 [Sorting Dictionaries]
Student: How do I sort a dictionary by values?
TA Response: Use sorted() with a lambda function:

my_dict = {"a": 3, "b": 1, "c": 2}
sorted_dict = dict(sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]))

@226 [Using Deques for Efficiency]
Student: Should I use a list or a deque for a queue?
TA Response: Use collections.deque for better performance when inserting/removing from both ends:

from collections import deque
q = deque()
q.append(1)  # O(1)
q.popleft()  # O(1)

Lists have O(n) time complexity for pop(0).

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

@227 [Difference Between __init__ and __new__]
Student: What’s the difference between __init__ and __new__?
TA Response:
	•	__new__ creates the instance (rarely used).
	•	__init__ initializes the instance (commonly used).
Example:

class Example:
    def __new__(cls):
        print("Creating instance")
        return super().__new__(cls)
    
    def __init__(self):
        print("Initializing instance")

@228 [Method Overriding in Python]
Student: Can we override a parent class method in Python?
TA Response: Yes, just redefine it in the child class:

class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello from Parent"

class Child(Parent):
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello from Child"

Call the parent’s method with super().greet().

Error Handling & Debugging

@229 [Handling KeyErrors]
Student: How do I prevent a KeyError when accessing a dictionary?
TA Response: Use .get() to return a default value instead of raising an error:

value = my_dict.get("key", "default_value")

@230 [Debugging with print() vs logging]
Student: Should we use print() or logging for debugging?
TA Response: print() is fine for quick debugging, but logging is better for production:

import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logging.debug("This is a debug message")

File Handling & OS Operations

@231 [Reading Large Files Efficiently]
Student: How do I read a large file without running out of memory?
TA Response: Use a generator instead of loading the entire file:

def read_file(filename):
    with open(filename) as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line

for line in read_file("large_file.txt"):
    process(line)

@232 [Checking If a File Exists]
Student: How do I check if a file exists before opening it?
TA Response: Use os.path.exists():

import os
if os.path.exists("file.txt"):
    with open("file.txt") as f:
        print(f.read())

Web Development with Flask

@233 [Returning JSON in Flask]

Instructor: Yes, SQLAlchemy is allowed for database integration in your Flask project.

Git & Version Control

@237 [Reverting a Git Commit]
Student: How do I undo my last commit?
TA Response: Use git reset if it’s local:

git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo commit but keep changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Undo commit and discard changes

Use git revert if it’s already pushed.

@238 [Cloning a Private GitHub Repo]
Student: How do I clone a private GitHub repo?
TA Response: Use SSH or personal access tokens:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/private-repo.git

Python Basics & Common Issues

@244 [Why is NoneType not subscriptable?]
Student: I got this error: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable. What does it mean?
TA Response: It means you’re trying to index ([]) a variable that is None.
Check if a function is returning None instead of a list/dictionary. Example fix:

data = my_function()
if data is not None:
    print(data[0])

@245 [Difference Between is and ==]
Student: What’s the difference between is and == in Python?
TA Response:
	•	== checks value equality (5 == 5 → True)
	•	is checks memory location ([] is [] → False)

Example:

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
print(a == b)  # True (same values)
print(a is b)  # False (different objects)

@246 [Using the Walrus Operator]
Student: Can we use the walrus operator (:=) in this course?
Instructor: Yes! Python 3.8+ introduced := for assignment expressions:

if (n := len(my_list)) > 10:
    print(f"List has {n} elements!")

Data Structures & Algorithms

@247 [When to Use Sets Instead of Lists]
Student: Should I use a set or a list to store unique items in HW4?
TA Response: Use a set for fast lookups since checking membership is O(1), compared to O(n) in lists:

unique_items = set(["apple", "banana", "apple"])  # Removes duplicates

@248 [Heap vs Stack Memory]
Student: What’s the difference between heap memory and stack memory in Python?
TA Response:
	•	Stack: Stores function calls & local variables (fast, but limited size).
	•	Heap: Stores objects & dynamic memory (larger, but slower).
Recursion issues often stem from stack overflows.

@249 [Lambda Functions in Python]
Student: Can we use lambda functions for HW5?

Flask & Web Development

@252 [CORS Error in Flask]
Student: My frontend can’t call my Flask API due to CORS issues. How do I fix this?
TA Response: Use Flask-CORS:

from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app)

@253 [Difference Between Flask session and cookies]
Student: Should we use Flask sessions or cookies for storing user data?
TA Response:
	•	Session: Stores data server-side (session['user'] = "Alice")
	•	Cookies: Stores data client-side (less secure)

Use sessions for sensitive data.

Databases & SQL

@254 [SQL JOIN vs NoSQL Queries]
Student: How do I join tables in SQLite?
TA Response: Use JOIN:

SELECT users.name, orders.amount
FROM users
JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;

In NoSQL (MongoDB), you typically use embedding instead.

@255 [Best Way to Store Passwords]
Student: How should we store passwords securely?
TA Response: Use bcrypt for hashing:

from bcrypt import hashpw, gensalt
hashed = hashpw(b"mypassword", gensalt())

Git & Version Control

@256 [What’s the Difference Between git pull and git fetch?]
Student: What’s the difference between git pull and git fetch?
TA Response:
	•	git fetch: Gets updates but doesn’t merge them.
	•	git pull: Fetches & merges changes from remote.

Use git fetch to preview changes before merging.

@257 [Recovering Deleted Branch in Git]
Student: I accidentally deleted my branch. How do I recover it?
TA Response: Run:

git reflog
git checkout -b my_branch HEAD@{1}

This restores the last known commit before deletion.

Exams & Deadlines

@258 [Midterm Exam Topics]
Student: What topics should we focus on for the midterm?
Instructor: The midterm covers:
✅ Python Basics (functions, loops, recursion)
✅ OOP (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
✅ Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
❌ No Flask or databases (final project only)

@259 [Final Exam Coding Section]
Student: Will we have to write code by hand for the final?
Instructor: No, the exam will be taken on computers in the lab.

Miscellaneous & Extra Credit

@260 [Best Python Books for Further Learning]
Student: What books do you recommend for Python beyond this course?
Instructor: Some great ones:
📘 Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho
📗 Effective Python by Brett Slatkin
📙 Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart

@261 [Python Easter Egg - import antigravity]
Student: Someone told me Python has a joke built in. Is that true?
TA Response: Yes! Try:

import antigravity

It opens an XKCD comic in your browser.

@262 [How to Write Cleaner Python Code]
Student: Any tips for writing cleaner Python code?
TA Response: Follow PEP 8:
	•	Use meaningful variable names (total_price instead of tp)
	•	Keep functions short & focused
	•	Use list comprehensions instead of long loops

Python Fundamentals & Common Issues

@263 [Why does id() return different values?]
Student: I noticed that id(var) returns different values each time I run my code. Why?
TA Response: id(var) gives the memory address of an object. If a variable is recreated, Python may allocate a new memory address. Example:

a = 10
print(id(a))  # Memory address of '10'
a = 20
print(id(a))  # New memory address for '20'

@264 [What does if __name__ == "__main__": do?]
Student: Why do some scripts use if __name__ == "__main__": at the bottom?
TA Response: It ensures the script only runs when executed directly, not when imported as a module. Example:

def main():
    print("This only runs when executed directly!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

@265 [Python Aliasing & Copying Lists]
Student: Why does modifying one list affect another?
TA Response: Assigning lists creates a reference, not a copy. Use copy() or deepcopy() to avoid this:

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a  # This is a reference, not a copy
b.append(4)
print(a)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]

# To create a copy:
c = a.copy()
c.append(5)
print(a)  # Unchanged: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Data Structures & Algorithms

@266 [Stack vs Queue Differences]
Student: What’s the difference between a stack and a queue?
TA Response:
	•	Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out): Think of a stack of plates. Use append() and pop().
	•	Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out): Like a line at a store. Use collections.deque().

Example:

from collections import deque

queue = deque()
queue.append(1)  # Enqueue
queue.popleft()  # Dequeue

@267 [Time Complexity of Dictionary Operations]
Student: Is dictionary lookup really O(1)?
TA Response: Yes, on average, but worst-case lookup is O(n) due to hash collisions.

Example:

d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
print(d["a"])  # O(1) lookup

@268 [Finding the Most Frequent Element]
Student: What’s the best way to find the most frequent item in a list?
TA Response: Use collections.Counter:

from collections import Counter

data = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "banana"]
freq = Counter(data)
print(freq.most_common(1))  # [('banana', 3)]

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

@269 [What’s super() in Python?]
Student: What does super() do in a class?
TA Response: super() calls parent class methods inside a child class. Example:

class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Parent")

class Child(Parent):
    def greet(self):
        super().greet()  # Calls Parent's greet()
        print("Hello from Child")

c = Child()
c.greet()

@270 [Difference Between Composition & Inheritance]
Student: Should we use inheritance or composition in OOP?
TA Response:
	•	Inheritance: “Is-a” relationship (Car is-a Vehicle).
	•	Composition: “Has-a” relationship (Car has-a Engine).

Example of composition:

class Engine:
    def start(self):
        print("Engine started!")

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = Engine()

c = Car()
c.engine.start()  # Car has an Engine

Flask & Web Development

@271 [Flask Auto-reload Not Working]
Student: My Flask app doesn’t reload automatically. What’s wrong?
TA Response: Make sure debug mode is enabled:

export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run

@272 [Flask Handling File Uploads]
Student: How do I upload files in Flask?
TA Response: Use request.files:

from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/upload", methods=["POST"])
def upload():
    file = request.files["file"]
    file.save(f"./uploads/{file.filename}")
    return "File saved!"

Database & SQL

@273 [SQL GROUP BY Explained]
Student: What does GROUP BY do in SQL?
TA Response: It groups rows with the same values and applies aggregate functions. Example:

SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department;

@274 [SQLite vs PostgreSQL]
Student: Should I use SQLite or PostgreSQL?
Instructor:
	•	SQLite: Best for small, local projects.
	•	PostgreSQL: Best for production, supports complex queries.

Git & Version Control

@275 [Undoing git commit --amend]
Student: I used git commit --amend but need to undo it. How?
TA Response:

git reset --soft HEAD@{1}

This restores your previous commit message.

@276 [Git Stash Use Case]
Student: When should I use git stash?
TA Response: Use it when you want to save changes temporarily without committing.

git stash   # Saves changes
git stash pop   # Restores changes

Exams & Deadlines

@277 [Final Exam Allowed Materials]
Student: Can we use external libraries during the final exam?
Instructor: Only built-in Python libraries (e.g., math, random, datetime) are allowed.

@278 [Late Submission Grace Period]
Student: Is there a grace period for submitting homework?
Instructor: No, but Canvas allows a 5-minute buffer in case of last-minute uploads.

Extra Credit & Miscellaneous

@279 [Extra Credit for Open Source Contributions]
Student: Can contributing to an open-source project count for extra credit?
Instructor: Yes! Submit a GitHub pull request link for approval.
